# Task-1---Simple-Linear-Regression
Problem Statement - Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

The above problem statement is solved using Simple Linear Regression.
The language used in the code is Python 3
The steps used for solving the above problem statement are: -
   1. Import Dependencies.
   2. Importing dataset.
   3. Visualizing data to check wether it is linear or not.
   4. Dividing the data into "attributes" (inputs) and "labels" (outputs).
   5. Splitting data for training and testing.
   6. Training the data for the algorithm.
   7. Plotting the regression line.
   8. Plotting for the test data.
   9. Prediction of the scores.
   10. Comparing Predicted and Actual Values
   11. Predicting the score for the required specification  i.e. 9.25 hours
          The score for 9.25 hours is 93.69173248737538
   12. Evaluating the model
        Methods used to evaluate the model are: -
         - Mean Absolute Error = 4.183859899002975
         - R2 Score for the model = 0.9546785947197246
         - Residual Sum of Squares = 107.99384653608699
